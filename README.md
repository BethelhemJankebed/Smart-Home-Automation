# Smart Home Automation System

*A JavaFX-based simulation for home monitoring, safety, and appliance control.*

## General Objective

To develop a smart home system that assists working parents, individuals with physical impairments, and homeowners in leading a safer, more convenient, and efficient life through automated control and monitoring features.

##  Statement of the Problem

Traditional homes lack intelligent automation to support daily activities, causing **inconvenience, safety risks, and inefficiency**.
This project addresses the following key problems:

* **Physically impaired individuals** struggle with operating devices like lights, doors, and appliances.
* **Parents cannot monitor their children** or caregivers while at work.
* **Small in-house shop owners** often face theft when stepping away from the shop.
* **Homeowners forget** to turn off appliances or lock doors, leading to energy waste and security risks.

Our smart home system provides simulated monitoring and device control to reduce these issues.

## Concepts & Technologies Used

This project is built using modern software engineering principles:

### ** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Abstraction

Used to model Devices, Rooms, Home, and Controllers as reusable objects.

### ** JavaFX (User Interface)**

* Interactive dashboard
* Scene switching/navigation
* Buttons, labels, event-driven control
* Simulated snapshots for monitoring and security

### ** Software Design Methodologies**

* **Agile Development** → Iterative progress, testing, and refinement
* **Object-Oriented Analysis & Design (OOAD)** → UML diagrams, class models, use cases

### **Additional Concepts**

* Event handling
* File logging (event/history recording)
* Modular architecture for future expansion

### Project Scope & Limitation

*This system is a simulation and can be accessed through mobile devices for monitoring and control.  
However, it does not interact with real IoT hardware such as lights, doors, or other appliances, and all device operations are simulated.*
